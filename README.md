**Advanced Continuous Glucose Monitoring Analysis with High-Performance C++ Backend**

A comprehensive R package for CGM data analysis implementing GRID algorithms and international consensus glycemic event detection with optimized C++ implementations via Rcpp.

## 🎯 Overview

cgmguru provides advanced tools for CGM data analysis with two primary capabilities:

- **GRID and postprandial peak detection**: Implements GRID (Glucose Rate Increase Detector) and GRID-based algorithms to detect postprandial peak glucose events
- **Glycemic events**: Detects hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes (Level 1/2/Extended) aligned with international consensus CGM metrics [1]

All core algorithms are implemented in optimized C++ via Rcpp for accurate and fast analysis on large datasets.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 High Performance**: C++ backend with efficient multi-subject processing and memory-optimized data structures
- **📊 GRID Algorithm**: Detects rapid glucose rate increases (commonly ≥90–95 mg/dL/hour) with configurable thresholds and gaps [2, 6]
- **📈 Postprandial Peak Detection**: Finds peak glucose after GRID points using local maxima and configurable time windows [4, 7]
- **🏥 Consensus CGM Metrics Event Detection**: Level 1/2 hypo- and hyperglycemia detection with duration validation (default minimum 15 minutes)
- **🔧 Advanced Analysis Tools**: Local maxima finding, excursion analysis, and robust episode validation utilities
- **📋 Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed function documentation with examples and parameter descriptions

## 📦 Installation

### From CRAN
```r
install.packages("cgmguru")
```

### From GitHub (development version)
```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("shstat1729/cgmguru")
```

### Dependencies
```r
# Required packages
install.packages(c("Rcpp", "iglu"))

# For examples and vignettes
install.packages(c("dplyr", "testthat"))
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Load Package and Data
```r
library(cgmguru)
library(iglu)
data(example_data_5_subject)
```

### Basic GRID Analysis
```r
# Detect rapid glucose rate increases
grid_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
print(grid_result$episode_counts)
```

### Comprehensive Event Detection
```r
# Detect all glycemic events (Level 1/2 hypo- and hyperglycemia)
all_events <- detect_all_events(example_data_5_subject, reading_minutes = 5)
print(all_events)
```

### Postprandial Peak Detection
```r
# Combined maxima and GRID analysis
maxima_result <- maxima_grid(example_data_5_subject, threshold = 130, gap = 60, hours = 2)
print(maxima_result$episode_counts)
```

## 📐 Data Format Requirements

Most functions expect a dataframe with the following columns:

- **`id`**: Patient identifier (character or factor)
- **`time`**: POSIXct timestamps
- **`gl`**: Glucose values in mg/dL

All function arguments and return values are expected to be in tibble format. For convenience, single-column parameters can be passed as vectors in R, which will be automatically converted to single-column tibbles.

### Data Preprocessing
```r
library(cgmguru)

# Pre-order your data by id and time (recommended)
df <- orderfast(df)
```

## ⚡ Rcpp Integration

cgmguru leverages Rcpp for high-performance C++ implementations:

- **Core algorithms** implemented in C++ for speed
- **Memory-efficient** data structures for large datasets
- **Efficient multi-subject processing** with optimized data handling
- **Seamless R integration** with automatic type conversion

### Performance Benefits
```r
# Benchmark comparison
library(microbenchmark)
library(iglu)

benchmark_results <- microbenchmark(
  iglu_episodes = episode_calculation(example_data_5_subject),
  cgmguru_events = detect_all_events(example_data_5_subject),
  times = 100,
  unit = "ms"
)

print(benchmark_results)
# cgmguru is ~300x faster than pure R implementations
```

## 🔬 Core Functionality

### GRID Algorithm
```r
# Basic GRID analysis
grid_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
print(grid_result$episode_counts)

# More sensitive analysis
sensitive_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = 10, threshold = 120)
```

### Postprandial Peak Detection
```r
# Fast method: Get postprandial peaks directly
maxima <- maxima_grid(example_data_5_subject,
                     threshold = 130,
                     gap = 60,
                     hours = 2)
print(maxima$episode_counts)
```

### Step-by-Step Postprandial Peak Detection
```r
# Detailed 7-step process for postprandial peak detection
threshold <- 130
gap <- 60
hours <- 2

# 1) Find GRID points
grid_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = gap, threshold = threshold)

# 2) Find modified GRID points before 2 hours minimum
mod_grid <- mod_grid(example_data_5_subject,
                     start_finder(grid_result$grid_vector),
                     hours = hours,
                     gap = gap)

# 3) Find maximum point 2 hours after mod_grid point
mod_grid_maxima <- find_max_after_hours(example_data_5_subject,
                                       start_finder(mod_grid$mod_grid_vector),
                                       hours = hours)

# 4) Identify local maxima around episodes/windows
local_maxima <- find_local_maxima(example_data_5_subject)

# 5) Among local maxima, find maximum point after two hours
final_maxima <- find_new_maxima(example_data_5_subject,
                               mod_grid_maxima$max_index,
                               local_maxima$local_maxima_vector)

# 6) Map GRID points to maximum points (within 4 hours)
transform_maxima <- transform_df(grid_result$episode_start, final_maxima)

# 7) Redistribute overlapping maxima between GRID points
final_between_maxima <- detect_between_maxima(example_data_5_subject, transform_maxima)
```

## 🏥 Consensus CGM Glycemic Events

These functions detect hypo-/hyperglycemic episodes aligned with Consensus CGM metrics rules. They differ by type and level. The helper `detect_all_events()` aggregates results across these detectors.
Events are counted only after the required recovery condition is confirmed. In detailed outputs, `end_time`, `end_glucose`, and `end_index` report the last dysglycemic reading immediately before the confirmed recovery period starts, so recovery minutes are not included in reported event boundaries.

### Parameter Notes
- **`start_gl`**: threshold to start/qualify an episode (mg/dL). For hyper: typical `180` (lv1) or `250` (lv2). For hypo: typical `70` (lv1) or `54` (lv2).
- **`end_gl`**: glucose level indicating episode resolution (e.g., 180 mg/dL for hyper Level 1).
- **`dur_length`**: minimum episode duration in minutes (default often 15 minutes for Level 1; may be longer for extended definitions).
- **`end_length`**: grace period for termination/contiguity in minutes.
- **`reading_minutes`**: CGM device sampling interval in minutes (e.g., 5 min for Dexcom, 15 min for Libre). Used to calculate minimum required readings for event validation based on the 3/4 rule: `ceil((dur_length / reading_minutes) / 4 * 3)`.

### Hypoglycemia Usage Methods
`detect_hypoglycemic_events()` supports both the recommended `type` preset method and custom criteria supplied with `start_gl`, `dur_length`, and `end_length`.

**Preset method (recommended):**
```r
detect_hypoglycemic_events(df, type = "lv1")       # Level 1 hypoglycemia
detect_hypoglycemic_events(df, type = "lv2")       # Level 2 hypoglycemia
detect_hypoglycemic_events(df, type = "extended")  # Extended hypoglycemia
```

**Custom criteria method:**
```r
detect_hypoglycemic_events(df, start_gl = 70, dur_length = 15, end_length = 15)  # Level 1
detect_hypoglycemic_events(df, start_gl = 54, dur_length = 15, end_length = 15)  # Level 2
detect_hypoglycemic_events(df, start_gl = 70, dur_length = 120, end_length = 15) # Extended
```

If an explicit `type` is supplied together with custom numeric criteria, the function returns results based on `type` and gives a warning that `dur_length`, `end_length`, and `start_gl` were ignored.

### Hyperglycemia Usage Methods
`detect_hyperglycemic_events()` supports both the recommended `type` preset method and custom criteria supplied with `start_gl`, `dur_length`, `end_length`, and `end_gl`.

**Preset method (recommended):**
```r
detect_hyperglycemic_events(df, type = "lv1")       # Level 1 hyperglycemia
detect_hyperglycemic_events(df, type = "lv2")       # Level 2 hyperglycemia
detect_hyperglycemic_events(df, type = "extended")  # Extended hyperglycemia
```

**Custom criteria method:**
```r
detect_hyperglycemic_events(df, start_gl = 180, dur_length = 15, end_length = 15, end_gl = 180)  # Level 1
detect_hyperglycemic_events(df, start_gl = 250, dur_length = 15, end_length = 15, end_gl = 250)  # Level 2
detect_hyperglycemic_events(df, start_gl = 250, dur_length = 120, end_length = 15, end_gl = 180) # Extended
```

If an explicit `type` is supplied together with custom numeric criteria, the function returns results based on `type` and gives a warning that `dur_length`, `end_length`, `start_gl`, and `end_gl` were ignored.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Installation Problems:**
```r
# Ensure Rcpp is properly installed
install.packages("Rcpp")
Rcpp::evalCpp("2 + 2")  # Should return 4

# Reinstall cgmguru
remove.packages("cgmguru")
remotes::install_github("shstat1729/cgmguru")
```

**Data Format Issues:**
```r
# Check data format
str(your_data)
# Should have: id (character), time (POSIXct), gl (numeric)

# Order data properly
your_data <- orderfast(your_data)
```

**Performance Issues:**
```r
# For large datasets, consider chunking
# Process subjects individually if memory is limited
unique_ids <- unique(your_data$id)
results <- lapply(unique_ids, function(id) {
  subset_data <- your_data[your_data$id == id, ]
  detect_all_events(subset_data, reading_minutes = 5)
})
```
