ü©∫ cgmguru: Advanced Continuous Glucose Monitoring Analysis
A high-performance R package for comprehensive CGM data analysis with optimized C++ implementations

üéØ Overview
cgmguru is a specialized R package designed for analyzing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) data with a focus on clinical accuracy and computational efficiency. The package implements the GRID (Glucose Rate Increase Detection) algorithm alongside comprehensive glycemic event detection capabilities, all optimized with C++ for high-performance analysis of large datasets.

‚ú® Key Features
üî¨ GRID Algorithm Implementation
GRID Detection: Identifies rapid glucose rate increases (‚â•90-95 mg/dL/hour)
Optimized Processing: C++-based implementation for fast analysis of multi-patient datasets
Configurable Parameters: Customizable thresholds, time gaps, and detection windows

üìä Comprehensive Glycemic Event Detection
Hypoglycemic Events: Level 1 (<70 mg/dL) and Level 2 (<54 mg/dL) detection
Hyperglycemic Events: Level 1 (181-250 mg/dL) and Level 2 (>250 mg/dL) detection
Clinical Accuracy: Follows established clinical guidelines for episode validation
Duration Analysis: Configurable minimum duration requirements (default: 15 minutes)

‚ö° High-Performance Computing
C++ Backend: All core algorithms implemented in optimized C++ using Rcpp
Multi-ID Support: Efficient batch processing of multiple patient datasets
Memory Efficient: Optimized data structures for large-scale analysis

üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Analysis Tools
