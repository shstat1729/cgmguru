Description: Tools for advanced analysis of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
    time-series, implementing GRID (Glucose Rate Increase Detector) and GRID-based
    algorithms for postprandial peak detection, and detection of hypoglycemic and
    hyperglycemic episodes (Levels 1/2/Extended) aligned with international consensus
    CGM metrics. Core algorithms are implemented in optimized C++ using 'Rcpp' to
    provide accurate and fast analysis on large datasets.
