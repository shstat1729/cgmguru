Description: Tools for analyzing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) time-series and
    detecting glycemic events using GRID-based methodologies. Includes utilities for
    identifying local maxima/minima, event segmentation around maxima, and summary
    transformations for downstream analysis. Core algorithms are implemented in C++
    via 'Rcpp' for performance.
