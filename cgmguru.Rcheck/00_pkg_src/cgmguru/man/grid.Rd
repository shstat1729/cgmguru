\title{GRID Algorithm for Glycemic Event Detection}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, gl}

\item{gap}{Gap threshold in minutes for event detection (default: 15)}

\item{threshold}{GRID slope threshold in mg/dL/hour for event classification (default: 130)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{results}: Dataframe with GRID analysis results including grid points and timing
  \item \code{episode_counts}: Dataframe with episode counts per subject
  \item \code{episode_list}: List of episode details for each subject
}
}
\description{
Implements the GRID (Glucose Rate Increase Detector) algorithm for detecting 
rapid glucose rate increases in continuous glucose monitoring data. The algorithm
identifies rapid glucose changes (commonly ≥90–95 mg/dL/hour) based on rate 
calculations and applies gap-based criteria for event detection, commonly used
for postprandial peak detection.

# Example CGM data
cgm_data <- data.frame(
  id = rep("subject1", 100),
  time = seq(as.POSIXct("2024-01-01 00:00:00"), 
             as.POSIXct("2024-01-01 23:59:00"), 
             by = "15 min"),
  gl = rnorm(100, mean = 140, sd = 30)
)

# Apply GRID algorithm
events <- grid(cgm_data, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
