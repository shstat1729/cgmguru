\title{cgmguru: Continuous Glucose Monitoring Analysis and GRID-Based Event Detection}
\description{
Tools for analyzing Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) time-series and detecting glycemic events using GRID-based methodologies. Includes utilities for identifying local maxima/minima, event segmentation around maxima, and summary transformations for downstream analysis. Core algorithms are implemented in C++ via 'Rcpp' for performance.
