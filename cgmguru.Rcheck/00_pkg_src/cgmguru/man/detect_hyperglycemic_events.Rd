\arguments{
\item{new_df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, gl}

\item{reading_minutes}{Time interval between readings in minutes (optional). Used to calculate minimum required readings for event validation based on the 3/4 rule: ceil((dur_length / reading_minutes) / 4 * 3)}

\item{dur_length}{Minimum duration in minutes for event classification (default: 120)}

\item{end_length}{End length criteria in minutes (default: 15)}

\item{start_gl}{Starting glucose threshold in mg/dL (default: 250)}

\item{end_gl}{Ending glucose threshold in mg/dL (default: 180)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{events_detailed}: Dataframe with detailed event information including start/end times, glucose values, duration, and average glucose
  \item \code{episode_counts}: Dataframe with episode counts per subject including total_events, avg_ep_per_day, avg_ep_duration, avg_ep_gl
  \item \code{episode_list}: List of episode details for each subject
}
}
\description{
Identifies and segments hyperglycemic events in CGM data based on specified
glucose thresholds and duration criteria aligned with international consensus 
CGM metrics (Battelino et al., 2023). Events are detected when glucose
exceeds the start threshold for the minimum duration and ends when glucose
falls below the end threshold for the specified end length.
