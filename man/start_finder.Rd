\title{Find Start Points for Event Analysis}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe with the first column containing an integer vector of 0s and 1s}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing start_indices with R-based (1-indexed) positions where episodes start
}
\description{
Finds R-based (1-indexed) positions where the value is 1 in an integer vector 
of 0s and 1s, specifically identifying episode start points. This function 
looks for positions where a 1 follows a 0 or is at the beginning of the vector,
which is useful for identifying the start of glycemic events or episodes.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create a binary vector indicating episode starts
binary_vector <- c(0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)
df <- data.frame(episode_starts = binary_vector)

# Find R-based indices where episodes start
start_points <- start_finder(df)
# Returns: start_indices = c(3, 6, 9) (1-indexed positions where 1 follows 0)
}
