\title{Modified GRID Analysis}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, gl}

\item{grid_point_df}{A dataframe containing grid points for analysis}

\item{hours}{Time window in hours for analysis (default: 2)}

\item{gap}{Gap threshold in minutes for event detection (default: 15)}
}
\value{
A list containing modified GRID analysis results with mod_grid_vector
}
\description{
Performs modified GRID analysis with custom parameters for specialized
glycemic event detection scenarios. This function allows for more flexible
GRID analysis with user-specified grid points and parameters.
}
\examples{
# Load sample data
library(iglu)
data(example_data_5_subject)
data(example_data_hall)

# First, get grid points
grid_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = 15, threshold = 130)

# Perform modified GRID analysis
mod_result <- mod_grid(example_data_5_subject, grid_result$grid_vector, hours = 2, gap = 15)
print(paste("Modified grid points:", nrow(mod_result$mod_grid_vector)))

# Modified analysis with different parameters
mod_result_1h <- mod_grid(example_data_5_subject, grid_result$grid_vector, hours = 1, gap = 10)

# Analysis on larger dataset
large_grid <- grid(example_data_hall, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
large_mod_result <- mod_grid(example_data_hall, large_grid$grid_vector, hours = 2, gap = 15)
print(paste("Modified grid points in larger dataset:", nrow(large_mod_result$mod_grid_vector)))
