\title{Detect Events Between Maxima}
\arguments{
\item{new_df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, gl}

\item{transform_df}{A dataframe containing summary information from previous transformations}
}
\value{
A list containing detailed episode information for events between maxima
}
\description{
Identifies and analyzes events occurring between detected maxima points,
providing detailed episode information for GRID analysis. This function
helps characterize the glucose dynamics between identified peaks.
