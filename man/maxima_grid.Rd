\title{Combined Maxima Detection and GRID Analysis}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, gl}

\item{threshold}{GRID slope threshold in mg/dL/hour for event classification (default: 130)}

\item{gap}{Gap threshold in minutes for event detection (default: 60)}

\item{hours}{Time window in hours for maxima analysis (default: 2)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{results}: Dataframe with combined maxima and GRID analysis results including grid_time, grid_gl, maxima_time, maxima_glucose, time_to_peak, grid_index, maxima_index
  \item \code{episode_counts}: Dataframe with episode counts per subject
  \item \code{episode_list}: List of episode details for each subject
}
}
\description{
Fast method for postprandial peak detection that combines local maxima detection 
with GRID analysis. Maps maxima to GRID points using a candidate search window
and provides comprehensive glycemic event detection and characterization. 
Final GRID-to-peak pairing is constrained to at most 4 hours.
