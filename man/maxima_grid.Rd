\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data.
Must include columns:
\itemize{
  \item \code{id}: Subject identifier (string or factor)
  \item \code{time}: Time of measurement (POSIXct)
  \item \code{gl}: Glucose value (integer or numeric, mg/dL)
}}

\item{threshold}{GRID slope threshold in mg/dL/hour for event classification (default: 130)}

\item{gap}{Gap threshold in minutes for event detection (default: 60).
This parameter defines the minimum time interval between consecutive GRID events.}

      \item \code{maxima_time}: Timestamp of peak glucose (POSIXct)
      \item \code{maxima_glucose}: Peak glucose value (mg/dL)
      \item \code{time_to_peak_min}: Time from GRID event to peak in minutes
      \item \code{grid_index}: R-based (1-indexed) row number of GRID event; \code{grid_time == df$time[grid_index]}, \code{grid_gl == df$gl[grid_index]}
      \item \code{maxima_index}: R-based (1-indexed) row number of peak; \code{maxima_time == df$time[maxima_index]}, \code{maxima_glucose == df$gl[maxima_index]}

\description{
Fast method for postprandial glucose peak detection combining GRID algorithm with local maxima analysis.
Detects meal-induced glucose peaks by identifying GRID events (rapid glucose increases) and mapping
them to corresponding local maxima within a search window. Local maxima are defined as points where
glucose values increase or remain constant for two consecutive points before the peak, and decrease
or remain constant for two consecutive points after the peak.

The 7-step algorithm:
(1) finds GRID points indicating meal starts
(2) identifies modified GRID points after minimum duration
(3) locates maximum glucose within the subsequent time window
(4) detects all local maxima using the two-consecutive-point criteria
(5) refines peaks from local maxima candidates
(6) maps GRID points to peaks within 4-hour constraint
(7) redistributes overlapping peaks.
