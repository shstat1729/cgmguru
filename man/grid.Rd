\title{GRID Algorithm for Glycemic Event Detection}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, gl}

\item{gap}{Gap threshold in minutes for event detection (default: 15)}

\item{threshold}{GRID slope threshold in mg/dL/hour for event classification (default: 130)}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item \code{grid_vector}: Tibble with GRID analysis results (grid column with 0/1 values)
  \item \code{episode_counts}: Tibble with episode counts per subject (id, episode_counts)
  \item \code{episode_start_total}: Tibble with episode start points (id, time, gl, indices)
  \item \code{episode_start}: Tibble with episode start information (id, time, gl)
}
}
\description{
Implements the GRID (Glucose Rate Increase Detector) algorithm for detecting 
rapid glucose rate increases in continuous glucose monitoring data. The algorithm
identifies rapid glucose changes (commonly ≥90–95 mg/dL/hour) based on rate 
calculations and applies gap-based criteria for event detection, commonly used
for the meal detection.

\examples{
# Load sample data
library(iglu)
data(example_data_5_subject)
data(example_data_hall)

# Basic GRID analysis on smaller dataset
grid_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
print(grid_result$episode_counts)

# More sensitive GRID analysis
sensitive_result <- grid(example_data_5_subject, gap = 10, threshold = 120)

# GRID analysis on larger dataset
large_grid <- grid(example_data_hall, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
print(paste("Detected", sum(large_grid$episode_counts$episode_counts), "episodes"))

# View detected grid points
head(grid_result$grid_vector)
