\title{GRID Algorithm for Glycemic Event Detection}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe containing CGM data with columns: id, time, glucose}

\item{gap}{Gap threshold in minutes for event detection (default: 15)}

\item{threshold}{Glucose threshold in mg/dL for event classification (default: 130)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing detected glycemic events with episode information
}
\description{
Implements the GRID (Gap-based Recognition of Interstitial glucose Dynamics) algorithm
for detecting glycemic events in continuous glucose monitoring data.

# Example CGM data
cgm_data <- data.frame(
  id = rep("subject1", 100),
  time = seq(as.POSIXct("2024-01-01 00:00:00"), 
             as.POSIXct("2024-01-01 23:59:00"), 
             by = "15 min"),
  glucose = rnorm(100, mean = 140, sd = 30)
)

# Apply GRID algorithm
events <- grid(cgm_data, gap = 15, threshold = 130)
